### Data Cleaning and Analysis

Welcome to the Data Cleaning and Analysis project! This repository focuses on cleaning missing data and analyzing property address data from the `PortfolioProject` database, specifically the `villehoussing` table. Our goal is to ensure data accuracy and prepare the dataset for further analysis.

#### Cleaning Missing Data

1. **Missing Property Address Population**
   - Cleans missing property addresses by populating them with available data from other records.

2. **Breaking Down Address**
   - Splits the property address into individual columns for address, city, and state.

3. **Removing Duplicates**
   - Removes duplicate records based on specified criteria.

#### Analysis and Data Transformation

4. **Adjusting "Sold as Vacant" Field**
   - Converts 'Y' and 'N' values in the "Sold as Vacant" field to 'Yes' and 'No' respectively for consistency.

#### Usage Instructions

1. Run the provided SQL queries against the `villehoussing` table in the `PortfolioProject` database.
2. Review the cleaned and transformed data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
3. Further analyze the data for insights or integrate it into other projects as needed.
